I am currently a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn">HKUST (GZ)</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://xinleihe.github.io">Xinlei He</a>.


Before that, I obtained my Master's degree at <a href='https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/'>Zhejiang University</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://yziqi.github.io'>Ziqi Yang</a>, and my Bachelor's degree at Hangzhou City University under the supervision of Prof. <a href='http://jsxy.hzcu.edu.cn/art/2023/2/17/art_265_29278.html'>Jinling Wei</a>.

My research interests lie in Trustworthy AI. Previously, I focused on exploring <b><i>how</i></b> potential security issues arise in ML models. Going forward, I intend to investigate <b><i>why</i></b> these security issues occur, aiming to develop a unified theory to explain the security vulnerabilities in ML models.
